Rapido Ride Booking is a feature-rich desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter, created to simulate a real-world ride-hailing experience with an intuitive interface and efficient backend logic. The application enables users to seamlessly book rides by entering their name, choosing pickup and drop locations, and initiating the booking process with a single click. Upon booking, the system automatically generates a random trip distance, computes the fare based on the distance, and intelligently assigns the closest available rider from a predefined list, ensuring a realistic allocation process. The clean and interactive GUI integrates user-friendly input fields, dropdown menus, and actionable buttons, complemented by a dynamic progress bar and live status updates to track the ride in real time. Internally, the application follows structured event-driven programming principles, handling input validation, ride creation, and rider matching through modular and reusable code. This project not only demonstrates strong skills in Python-based GUI development but also showcases the integration of business logic, randomization algorithms, and responsive UI elements to deliver a complete, end-to-end ride-booking simulationâ€”making it an excellent demonstration of both problem-solving capability and practical software design
